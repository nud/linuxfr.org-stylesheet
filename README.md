This commit is used as a temporary place to store compiled CSS files for
LinuxFR.

The idea is to use it through rawgithub.com to test the CSS on the live
site. Commit messages mean nothing, and this repository will vanish as
soon as the changes are integrated into the main LinuxFR repository.

You have been warned.
